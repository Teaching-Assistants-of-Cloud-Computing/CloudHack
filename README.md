- To get started, download this repository (green icon at the top right of this repository that reads **Code** and then **Download ZIP**). You do **NOT** have to fork this repository or create a pull request.
- Unzip the downloaded file.
- Work with the directory corresponding to the problem statement assigned to you.
- Markdown files like ```README.md``` are automatically rendered on the Github website. To read the instructions clearly, keep the corresponding tab with ```README.md``` file open.

## Using GitHub

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) to sign up. It's a good idea to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already since it would let you work on your local computer and sync with GitHub with much more ease. If this is your first time with Git, setup your username and email on your terminal as follows:  
`git config --global user.name "<your_name>"`  
`git config --global user.email "<your_email>"`

2. [Create an Organization for Your Team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)  
   Name the organization as follows: '111-222-333-444-CloudHack-X' where '111', '222', '333', '444' are the last 3 digits of the SRNs of all the team members, in ascending order, and 'X' is the problem statement assigned (1, 2, or 3).
   
3. [Invite your team members to join the organization.](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/inviting-users-to-join-your-organization)
4. Create a new Repository under this organization for the purpose of this hackathon. Refer to this [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-push-an-existing-project-to-github) for creating a new repository on Github and commiting files. Name the repository 'CloudHack_X' where 'X' is the problem statement assigned (1, 2, or 3) and make sure to keep the repository **private**. Your repository should always remain **private** unless asked or given permission to do so. 
5. Grant everyone in your team 'Admin' capabilities on this repository. To manage access, follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository) guide. This makes sure everyone can individually commit their contributions and is visible on Github.
6. If your project does not have a ```README.md``` file, add one. Mention the complete **srn** and **section** of all the team members. Add a couple of lines describing what you have implemented in the project, any features that make your implementation unique from the rest of the submissions. If you already completed Viva, push the final code and mention what all changes you were required to make. Here's a [reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html) on how to push newly added files to Github.
7. Based on the problem statement assigned (1, 2, or 3), invite one of the following TA's to the repository: 
    - Problem Statement 1: [@manahshetty](https://github.com/manahshetty)
    - Problem Statement 2: [@Ash110](https://github.com/Ash110)
    - Problem Statement 3: [@IamShubhamGupto](https://github.com/IamShubhamGupto)
